Hello, reader!

Welcome to my blog. My name is Isaac McFadyen, and I'm a Canadian student studying Computer Science at Trent University in Ontario, Canada. I'm passionate about web technology and software and love working on new projects. I'm a Community MVP for the [Cloudflare Community](https://community.cloudflare.com) and a Community Champion on the [Cloudflare Developers Discord](https://discord.gg/cloudflaredev) - feel free to stop by and say hi!

I run [AS213339](/as213339) that I use to learn about BGP and network technologies. If you're like to peer, please reach out - I only advertise out of Toronto right now but plan to expand to other cities in the future.

I plan to write a post shortly about the stack that this blog is running on - it's not a traditional Wordpress or Ghost instance... but more on that later. Until then, thanks for stopping by!
